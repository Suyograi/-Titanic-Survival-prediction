# -Titanic-Survival-prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about passengers, such as their age, class, and fare. We explore the data, perform feature engineering, and train a machine learning model to make predictions.
